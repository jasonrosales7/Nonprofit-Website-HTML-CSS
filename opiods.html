<center><h2>Opioid Epidemic</h2></center>
<element id="opioidPic"><img src="OpioidsMedia/opioid.jpg" alt="opioid image" style ="display: block;margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;"></element>

<p>The United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic. This page has been created to bring awareness to this issue and to provide preventative steps to reduce the risk of you or a loved one from becoming addicted to opioids. In addition, this page was created to demonstrate that is an issue is prevalent no matter where you live, whether that is in a city, rural area, or suburb like the Town of Fairfield. </p>

<p>It is important to understand that many opioid addictions and opioid related deaths started with a prescription to deal with pain related to a sports injury, medical procedures or a chronic issue. Those taking the prescription then become addicted. Once they no longer have access to prescribed medications, or can't afford the legally acquired prescription medications, they turn to more affordable and readily available illegal options such as heroin, fentanyl, or other similar opioids. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2 out of every 3 drug overdoses involve opioids. </p>

<h2>Different Opioids</h2>
<p><b>Prescription opioids</b> - prescribed by doctors to treat moderate to severe pain, but can also have serious risks and side effects. Common types of prescription opioids include: oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), morphine, and methadone.</p>

<p><b>Fentanyl </b>- a synthetic opioid pain reliever. It 50-100 times more potent than opioids like morphine and is approved for treating severe pain, typically advanced cancer pain. Illegally made and distributed, fentanyl has been on the rise in several states including Connecticut. </p>

<p><b>Heroin </b> - an illegal opioid. Heroin usage has increased across the US among men and women, most age groups, and people of all income levels.</p>

<h2>How to Properly Dispose of Opioid Medications</h2>

<p>One of the most important ways to help prevent the misuse of opioids is to properly dispose of any&nbsp;unused prescription opioid medication. </p>

<p>The Fairfield Police Department has a medication drop box. Individuals can simply drop prescription and over-the-counter medications no questions asked and no information given to Police. This drop box can be found:</p>

<p><strong>At Police headquarters at 100 Reef Road, Fairfield, in the front lobby </strong></p>

<p> Please bring medications in original containers with the label removed. For more information on medications that are accepted or not accepted at the drug drop box please visit this <a href="https://www.fpdct.com/community/meddrop">website</a>.&nbsp;<a href="OpioidsMedia/Medication_Disposal_Flyer.pdf">Here</a>&nbsp;is a list of all locked drug boxes in the Greater Bridgeport area. </p>
